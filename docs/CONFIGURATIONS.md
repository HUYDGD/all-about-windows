### **My Powerplan**
- **Powerplan** is a built in feature that allows you to control the power settings of your computer. It can be used to set the power plan to high performance, balanced, power saver or a custom one. My configuration is adapted to fit any system and most of it is taken from the already great Bitsum powerplan. My configuration file can be downloaded here: [Powerplan Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luke-beep/guide-to-optimizing-windows/main/configurations/Powerplan_LukeHjo2611.pow). To import this profile you'd have to follow these 4 simple steps:
> 1. Open CMD with elevated privileges.
> 2. Type in `powercfg -import "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\Powerplan_LukeHjo2611.pow"`
> 3. Press enter
> 4. Open the powerplan settings and select the imported powerplan or type in `powercfg -list` and then `powercfg -setactive <GUID>` where `<GUID>` is the GUID of the powerplan you want to use.
