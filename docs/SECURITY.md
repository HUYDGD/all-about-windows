# Security Policy

This guide is designed to help users optimize their Windows operating system, and as such, it does not contain any software that could introduce security vulnerabilities. However, there are still a few best things to be wary about.

- Only download software from reputable sources, and ensure that you are downloading the correct version for your operating system.
- Keep your operating system and software up-to-date with the latest security updates and patches.
- Regularly backup your data and store backups securely.

If you are unsure about any steps in this guide or are uncomfortable making changes to your system, open an issue and we'll figure it out.
