**<summary>Interrupts</summary>**

Interrupts are fundamental to how a computer system operates and responds to both internal and external events. They allow a computer to efficiently handle asynchronous tasks and events.

### 1. **Hardware Interrupts (IRQs)**

- **Definition**: Generated by hardware devices like keyboards, mice or network cards. They signal to the CPU that a device requires its attention.
    
- **Use Cases**:
    - Key presses or mouse movements.
    - A packet of data has arrived on a network interface.
    - A disk read or write operation has completed.
    
- **Handling**: When a hardware interrupt occurs, the CPU stops its current task, saves its state, and executes a piece of code (Interrupt Service Routine or ISR) specific to the device that generated the interrupt.

### 2. **Software Interrupts**

- **Definition**: Generated by software running on the system, typically to request services from the operating system. 
    
- **Use Cases**:
    - An application wants to read a file from disk or send data over the network (system calls).
    - A program encounters an error and raises an exception.

- **Handling**: Similar to hardware interrupts, the CPU stops its current activity to handle the software interrupt. The difference is in the origin (software instead of hardware).

### 3. **Inter-Processor Interrupts (IPIs)**

- **Definition**: In multi-core or systems, one processor might need to notify another processor of an event.
    
- **Use Cases**:
    - Cache synchronization between cores.
    - Notifying other cores about task scheduling or priority changes.

- **Handling**: The receiving processor handles the IPI like any other interrupt, pausing its current task to deal with the IPI request.

### 4. **Exceptions**

- **Definition**: Exceptions are unplanned interrupts that occur when a program does something unexpected or illegal, such as dividing by zero or accessing invalid memory.

- **Use Cases**:    
    - Illegal operations like division by zero.
    - Access violations, such as dereferencing a null pointer.

- **Handling**: When an exception occurs, the system often transfers control to an exception handler. Depending on the severity and configuration, the handler might correct the problem, terminate the program, or notify the user.
    
### 5. **Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs)**

- **Definition**: DPCs are a mechanism in Windows for handling deferred work that arises from hardware interrupts. Present in Windows NT.
    
- **Use Cases**:
    - A network card has received data. The ISR handles the immediate task of acknowledging receipt, but the processing of the data (e.g., passing it up the network stack) is deferred to a DPC to ensure the ISR completes quickly.

- **Handling**: After an ISR schedules a DPC, the DPC runs at a lower priority than the ISR, ensuring that it doesn't block other critical tasks but still gets processed relatively quickly.
    
### Significance of Interrupts

Interrupts allow computers to appear to multitask, handling many operations and devices simultaneously. Without interrupts, a computer would have to continuously poll devices to check their status, a highly inefficient process.

High interrupt rates can lead to system performance issues, especially if the system spends a significant time handling interrupts and less time executing regular tasks. This is why understanding and optimizing interrupt handling, especially in performance-critical applications, is important.
